# Project Installation and Setup Guide

## Project Description

The project is a web application divided into two parts: the Client and the Server.

### Client

The Client is responsible for the front-end part of the application. It is located in the `Client` directory and uses Redux for state management. The Client provides a user interface for interacting with the application and communicates with the Server to fetch and update data.

### Server

The Server is responsible for the back-end part of the application. It handles requests from the Client, performs necessary operations, and interacts with a database if required. The Server is located in a separate directory, which is not specified in the given context. It provides the necessary APIs and business logic to support the functionality of the application.

## Stack and Packages

The project utilizes the following stack and packages:

### Client

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state.
- React Router: A library for handling routing in React applications.
- Axios: A library for making HTTP requests from the browser.
- Other packages as specified in the project's `package.json` file.

### Server

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- Other packages as specified in the project's `package.json` file.

## Installation and Setup

To install and run the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from the source control system.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.

### Client

To install and start the Client, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Client` directory.
2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Once the installation is complete, you can start the Client by running the following command: `npm start`

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

### Server

To install and start the Server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the Server directory.
2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Once the installation is complete, you can start the Server by running the following command: `npm start`
   This will start the Server and it will be ready to handle requests from the Client.

Please note that the specific commands and steps may vary depending on the project's structure and requirements. Make sure to check the project's documentation or README file for any additional instructions or configuration details.
